## Overview

Some women from Rittenhouse Political stopped by Code for Philly in September 2015 to ask for help with a data set in CSV. They would like to visually display the data in tables, graphs, and ultimately a "heat map" to show how women have been represented in PA from 2000-2014. Click the developer's link to go to the GitHub page. We are working in JavaScript to display this data in a palatable manner for end users.

There are two separate maps to display for the heat map.  One shows the House of Representatives district lines, while the other shows the Senate District lines.  See the links for the map outlines:
